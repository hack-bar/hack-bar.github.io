# // Intro
hackbar.ch is a free and open event, centered around the topic of (cyber-)security and the <3 for computers.
With the upcoming hackbar easter event edition we are going to tune live into *the* [Revision (demo-)party](https://2023.revision-party.net/), while also hacking the [Hacky Easter 2023 CTF](https://www.hackyeaster.com/). ü§©üêáü•ö


Everybody is welcome to join the festivities.

## // What
*The* [Revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_(demoparty)) is a demoparty, which takes place on Easter in Saarbr√ºcken in Germany. A [demoparty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene#Parties) is an event where demosceners and other computer enthusiasts gather to take part in competitions (nicknamed "compos"), where they present demos (short audio-visual presentations of computer art) and other works such as digital art and music.
We'll cozy up and tune into the live stream of the Revision together, play [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_Flag) and have fun.
For the CTF, we're going going to play the legendary [Hacky Easter 2023 CTF](https://www.hackyeaster.com/).

If you want to participate in the CTF or also feel the urge to come up with a demo yorself, be sure to bring along your laptop and power-adapter - everything else is cared for and present at the hackbar.

Everybody is welcome to join the event. The bar is stocked with [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) drinks and [tschunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschunk).

## // Covid
We do plan to make the event happen, but if push comes to shove, we will have to put either mask restrictions in place or even go as far as to cancel the event.  
Again, if it should happen that we have to cancel the event, we will update this website accordingly.
