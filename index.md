## // What
[Revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_(demoparty)) is a demoparty which takes place on Easter in Saarbr√ºcken in Germany. A [demoparty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene#Parties) is an event where demosceners and other computer enthusiasts gather to take part in competitions, nicknamed compos, where they present demos (short audio-visual presentations of computer art) and other works such as digital art and music.

We watch cozy the live stream of the Revision together, play CTF and do have fun. Everybody is welcome to join the event. The bar is stocked with club-mate and [tschunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tschunk).
