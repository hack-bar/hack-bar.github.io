# // Intro
hack-bar.ch is a free and open event, focused on (cyber-)security and the <3 for computers.
Everybody is welcome.

## // What
Initially, the idea was to meet up to watch live-streams of the yearly Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) together.  
Especially as the pandemic hit during the end of 2020 and 2021, the Congress was held online (the remote CCC was known as "rC3").  
The tradition of watching the CCC streams together grew in popularity, more friends joined, and now we want to make it an open event for everybody to join.  

## // When
27.-30.12.2022 

## // Where
Bahnstrasse 44, 3008 Bern, Switzerland

## // Cost of Entry
None, we do however accept donations and do have a cool donor bracelet waiting for you (i.e. you can pay what you think the event is worth to you).

## // CCC 2022
Yes, we know that the Congress in Hamburg was cancelled for this year. If a rC3-like alternative event would happen, we would watch streams from there and if not,  
we would surely have alternative streams and presentations ready for your community viewing experience. (See [events.ccc.de](https://events.ccc.de/category/37c3/))

## // Covid
We also do recognize that (most likely) the next covid wave is about to start.  
Hence, we do plan to make the event happen, but if push comes to shove, we will have to put either mask restrictions in place or even go as far as to cancel the event.  
Again, if it should happen that we have to cancel the event, we will update this website accordingly.

## // Questions
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the organizers via email:

## // Code of Conduct
The usual "no bullshit" & "be excellent to each other".

## // Wanted List

Please contact the organizers, and we'll make it happen. :)

## // FAQ

A: We advise joining on the 29.12. or 30.12.2022. As we expect the most people on these days.
